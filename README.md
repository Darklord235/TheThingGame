# The Thing
##A coded board game

An alien is trying to kill you. An alien is a player that all of the other players do not know.
The alien is selected randomly by using a deck of cards that either has "Alien" or "Survivor".
Players can call a vote at Safe Zones.
If the alien gets to the Helicopter (end of the board), the game is over.
If the alien is killed, the players win.

There are three items to use to the "Survivors" and "Aliens" advantage.
> Axe: Move target player back 1 space.
> Gun: Move target player back 2 spaces.
> Flamethrower: Move target player back 3 spaces.
> Teleporter: Teleport a target player to you.
> Shield: A safe zone appears in your spot for 2 turns. You may not buy items.

These items are bought from a "Safe Zone". A "Safe Zone" can be found at every spot divisible by 3.
Spot 3, 6, 9, and 12 would be examples of a "Safe Zone" area. 
You may only use these items when a player or alien is one space away from your current location.
