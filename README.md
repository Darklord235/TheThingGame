# The Thing
##A coded board game

An alien is trying to kill you. An alien is a player that all of the other players do not know.
The alien is selected randomly by using a deck of cards that either has "Alien" or "Survivor".
Players can call a vote at Safe Zones.
If the alien gets to the Helicopter (end of the board), the game is over.
If the alien is killed, the players win.

There are five items to use to the "Survivors" and "Aliens" advantage.

>1: Firehose (Knock a target player back 5 spaces)

>2: Bike (Moves forward by 5 spaces)

>3: Speed Drug (Roll twice but move back by 3 spaces)

>4: Shield (Protection from 1 playerâ€™s item)

>5: Teleportation device (Skip 3 turn and teleport 3 spaces out of the base)

There are 5 types of traps that are present in the game

>

These items are bought from a "Safe Zone". A "Safe Zone" can be found at every spot divisible by 3.
Spot 3, 6, 9, and 12 would be examples of a "Safe Zone" area. 
You may only use these items when a player or alien is one space away from your current location.
